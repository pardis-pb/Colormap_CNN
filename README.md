This repository is inline with our published article at Information Sciences entitled as _"Color by Numbers: The Implications of Colormap Selection in Deep Learningâ€™s Perception"_ and includes two sample codes for:
- Time Frequency representation preparation of signals using 7 different colormaps. The TFs are automatically divided and saved as train and test set to be used further as the input layer of a CNN model - Matlab Code.
- A sample CNN model (transfer learning through ResNet50) to read the RGB images of TF representations for classification purposes - Python code, keras tensorflow.

We have included comments including links and references in the code for better generalisation.
